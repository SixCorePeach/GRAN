The environment of model training is Unbantu 16.04, with Nvidia RTX6000 24G. 
We has tried to implement the segmentation task of ISIC2018 test, and got the 104 in real time ranking at time 2023/4/23.
To be honestï¼Œin order to improve our model generation, we use the GAN to let GIAN to learning the distrubution of lesion, and get more steady result as the ISIC_result.png.
